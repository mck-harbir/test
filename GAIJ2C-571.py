Generate Code for this requirement: 
Given the following user information,

User Name: Testuser
User Id: 1234
User Location Id: 1000
Watch History Items:  [{2, 3, 1, 1977796234}](https://t.co/GcjJb5E02s?amp=1) (movieIds = [3, 1, 1977796234])


When I run the algorithm,

Then the algorithm should return relevant movies and TV shows,
And return a mix of personalized recommendations and content suggestions based on the user's watch history and preferences.


Given I am a registered user in a production environment,
When I browse for personalized recommendations or content suggestions,
Then the algorithm should provide recommendations that align with the user's preferences and watch history,
And the recommendations should be returned in a timely and efficient manner,
And the recommendations should not conflict with any other ongoing or planned content on the platform.
