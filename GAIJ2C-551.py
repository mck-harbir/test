Step 4: Create Unit Tests for the User Management Model (Optional)

Unit testing is an essential component of software development to ensure the correct functioning of code. In this step, you will create unit tests for the User Management model functionality.

1. Install the necessary packages using npm by running the following command:
npm install mocha @types/mocha chai chai-as-promised sinon --save-dev
2. Create a new spec file called userManagementModel.spec.ts and import the necessary modules and utilities for testing.
3. Define unit tests for the getFormattedUser function with valid and invalid inputs.
4. In the getFormattedUser function test, create a full fixture containing all the necessary data for a user.
5. Create a fixture called singleUser with a different user, with only the 'username' field.
6. In the getUser function test, use the singleUser fixture and ensure the transformed user matches the one in the fixture.
7. In the editUser function test, create two fixtures: one with valid parameters and another with invalid parameters, and set the valid parameters to the editUser function as a parameter.
8. After setting the editUser function parameters, check for the transformed user returned from the editUser function.
9. Run the unit tests and ensure they pass.
